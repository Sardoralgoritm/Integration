# Personnel Records Management ‚Äì Test Task

This project was implemented as part of a technical test task for a job application.  
It is an **ASP.NET Core MVC** application with SQL Server (locally) and Azure SQL Database (in production).  

## üöÄ Features
- Import personnel records from a CSV file.
- Display records in a searchable and paginated table (DataTables).
- Edit existing personnel records.
- Validation and error handling for invalid or duplicate records.
- Unit tests for key controller actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **SQL Server / Azure SQL Database**
- **Bootstrap 5**
- **jQuery DataTables**
- **xUnit** (for unit testing)

## ‚ö° Additional Work (beyond the requirements)
- Configured **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions**.
- Deployed the application to **Azure App Service**.
- Configured **Azure SQL Database** as the main data source.
- Managed secrets and connection strings via **Azure App Service Configuration** (instead of storing in `appsettings.json`).
